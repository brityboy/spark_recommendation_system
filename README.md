The purpose of this repo is to have a simple, working, well-documented,
easy-to-read code for a working matrix factorization based recommendation
system using Spark - tested with the movielens dataset
(http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-20m-README.html), but
with instructions on how to use this kind of code (with generic functions)
on other datasets - in order to make Spark's matrix factorization
recommender more user friendly and easier to understand for individuals
new to data science and machine learning
